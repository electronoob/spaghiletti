This repo is for an attempt at improving framerate with the
SSD1306 OLED Display, from one hung low somehwere in china.

The initial code I commit now is from Julian Ilett of
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmHvGf00GDuPYG9DZqQKd9A fame.

He doesn't specify a license but I imagine it's something open.

Julian increased the performance massively, I hope to tweak his
work just a little bit further and port it to AVR natively.

The video Julian posted is here:
