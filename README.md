This repo is for an attempt at improving framerate with the
SSD1306 OLED Display, from one hung low somehwere in china.

Ported from Arduino to Atmel Studio project (AVR).


The initial code I based this project on is from Julian Ilett of
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmHvGf00GDuPYG9DZqQKd9A fame.

He doesn't specify a license but I imagine it's something open,
I propose MIT license on my git repo.

Julian increased the performance massively and I have completed
porting the code with what I believe to be further speed increases.
