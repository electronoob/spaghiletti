This repo is for an attempt at improving framerate with the
SSD1306 OLED Display, from one hung low somehwere in china.


Currently porting to AVR, providing Atmel Studio project files.
Still very much a work in progress.



The initial code I based this project on is from Julian Ilett of
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmHvGf00GDuPYG9DZqQKd9A fame.

He doesn't specify a license but I imagine it's something open.

Julian increased the performance massively, I hope to tweak his
work just a little bit further and port it to AVR natively.
